  "training": {
    "introduction": "This technical deep-dive module focuses on architecting a robust, scalable, and secure CI/CD pipeline tailored for a high-traffic e-commerce platform. Building upon your existing knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes, we will explore advanced deployment strategies and automation.",
    "keyConcepts": [
      "CI vs. CD vs. CD: Understanding the nuances between Continuous Integration (merging code), Continuous Delivery (releasable artifacts), and Continuous Deployment (automated production releases).",
      "Pipeline Security (DevSecOps): Integrating static analysis (SAST), dynamic analysis (DAST), and container vulnerability scanning directly into the pipeline.",
      "Artifact Management: Utilizing a private registry like Harbor or AWS ECR for versioned, immutable Docker images.",
      "Zero-Downtime Deployments: A detailed breakdown of the Blue-Green deployment pattern, including traffic shifting and health check validation.",
      "Automated Rollbacks: Configuring Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes to trigger automated rollbacks upon deployment failure."
    ],
    "exampleScenario": "An e-commerce platform needs to deploy a critical update to its 'checkout' microservice during peak shopping hours. A failed deployment could result in millions in lost revenue. The pipeline must ensure a seamless, risk-free update."

  "puzzle": {
    "description": "Let's test your understanding of deployment strategies.",
    "question": "When implementing a blue-green deployment, at what stage is the production traffic switched from the current 'blue' environment to the new 'green' environment?",
    "options": [
      "Immediately after the 'green' environment is built.",
      "After the 'green' environment passes all automated integration and smoke tests.",
      "Simultaneously, with traffic split 50/50 for A/B testing.",
      "Only after the 'blue' environment is decommissioned."

  "exercise": {
    "description": "Now, let's design a pipeline stage.",
    "scenario": "You are tasked with enhancing the security of your existing CI/CD pipeline. A new requirement mandates that no container with a 'High' or 'Critical' vulnerability can be deployed to production.",
    "tasks": [
      "Define the YAML configuration for a new pipeline stage that uses a tool like 'Trivy' or 'Clair' to scan a Docker image after it's built but before it's pushed to the artifact registry.",
      "Implement the logic within the stage to fail the pipeline build if any 'High' or 'Critical' vulnerabilities are detected.",
      "Configure an automated notification system (e.g., via Slack or email) to alert the development team with a link to the vulnerability report when a build fails this stage."
